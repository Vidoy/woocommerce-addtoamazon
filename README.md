 *** "Buy on Amazon" Wordpress WooCommerce "plugin" ***
 
 This "plugin" changes the "Add to Cart" button to "Buy on Amazon" and opens the link
 to an amazon product url. It also works with affiliate links. It will open the URL in 
 a new page or tab, and will only take affect if an Amazon URL is defined for the 
 specific product.

 This is not a module, it's simply a few lines of code that you can implement. Simply 
 follow the guide in Buy on Amazon module.txt
 
 I hereby grant you right to edit, sell, sublience and do whatever you want with this
 code. No credit is needed nor wanted.
 
 This was made for WooCommerce 4.7.1, but should work for a long time unless they
 drastically alter the code. You may (and probably will) need to reapply the code if
 you update WooCommerce.
