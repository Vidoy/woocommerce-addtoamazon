/*

 *** "Buy on Amazon" Wordpress WooCommerce "plugin" ***
 
 This "plugin" changes the "Add to Cart" button to "Buy on Amazon" and opens the link
 to an amazon product url, also works with affiliate links. It will open the URL in a 
 new page or tab.

 This is not a module, it's simply a few lines of code that you can implement. Simply 
 replace the code below as instructed.
 
 I hereby grant you right to edit, sell, sublience and do whatever you want with this
 code. No credit is needed nor wanted.
 
 This was made for WooCommerce 4.7.1, but should work for a long time unless they
 drastically alter the code. You may (and probably will) need to reapply the code if
 you update WooCommerce.
