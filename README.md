 *** "Buy on Amazon" Wordpress WooCommerce plugin ***
 
 This "plugin" changes the "Add to Cart" button to "Buy on Amazon" and opens the link
 to an amazon product url, also works with affiliate links. It will open the URL in a 
 new page or tab.

 I'm not learning the entire structure of WooCommerce and making an entire module and
 updating it each version just for these few lines, you can simply implement this by 
 choosing WooCommerce in your Wordpress Pludin Editor. Simply replace the code below 
 as instructed.
 
 I hereby grant you right to edit, sell, sublience... do whatever you want with this
 code, make nuclear bombs with it for all I care.
 
 This was made for WooCommerce 4.7.1, but should work for a long time unless they
 drastically alter the code. You may need to reapply the code if you update 
 WooCommerce.
